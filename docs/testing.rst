Testing
=======

Comprehensive testing strategies and examples across all supported languages.

Testing Philosophy
------------------

* **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
* **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
* **Performance Tests**: Benchmark and profile code
* **Security Tests**: Validate security practices

Test Structure
--------------

Each language has its own testing approach:

* **Python**: pytest with fixtures and mocking
* **JavaScript**: Jest with mocking and async testing
* **Java**: JUnit 5 with parameterized tests

Running Tests
-------------

See the Getting Started guide for detailed instructions on running tests
for each language.
