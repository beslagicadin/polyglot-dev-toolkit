Introduction
============

The Polyglot Development Toolkit is designed to demonstrate best practices
and provide reusable utilities across multiple programming languages.

Project Goals
-------------

* **Language Agnostic Patterns**: Show how similar problems can be solved 
  elegantly in different programming languages
* **Best Practices**: Demonstrate modern coding standards, testing approaches,
  and development workflows
* **Performance**: Provide benchmarking and optimization examples
* **Security**: Implement secure coding practices and vulnerability scanning
* **Maintainability**: Create clean, well-documented, and testable code

Supported Languages
-------------------

Python
~~~~~~
Modern Python 3.8+ with type hints, async/await, and comprehensive testing.

JavaScript/Node.js
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ES6+ features with both browser and Node.js compatibility.

Java
