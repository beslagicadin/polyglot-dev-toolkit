Performance
===========

Performance optimization techniques and benchmarking across languages.

Benchmarking
------------

The project includes comprehensive performance testing:

* Algorithmic complexity analysis
* Memory usage profiling
* Execution time benchmarking
* Cross-language performance comparison

Optimization Techniques
-----------------------

* **Caching**: Implement intelligent caching strategies
* **Async Operations**: Use async/await patterns effectively
* **Memory Management**: Optimize memory usage patterns
* **Algorithm Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithms for scale
